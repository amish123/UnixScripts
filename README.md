# UnixScripts
4th Semester - Codes for UNIX shell programming @ JMI, New Delhi


1.  WASS to implement a function mycd() using which you would be able to shuttle between directories. This function should work     in the following manner:
        $mycd dir -> cd to directory dir
        $mycd -   ->cd to previous directory

2.  WASS to implement 'wc' command without using the wc. The script can recieve the option l w c to indicate whether no. of lines/word/char from the user i/p are to be counted.
    The user may use all or any of the option. If wrong option return INVALID option.
Reference : WASS => Write a Shell Script.
